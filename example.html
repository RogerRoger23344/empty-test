<!--
This file would contain the content of www.amazon.com in a real implementation.
Since direct web scraping is not possible in this environment, this is a placeholder.

In a real implementation, you would need to:
1. Use appropriate libraries (like requests and BeautifulSoup) to fetch and parse the content
2. Ensure compliance with Amazon's terms of service and robots.txt
3. Handle proper error cases and timeouts

Example implementation (not executed):
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_amazon_content():
    try:
        response = requests.get('https://www.amazon.com', 
                               headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        return f"<!-- Error fetching content: {str(e)} -->"

content = get_amazon_content()
with open('example.html', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(content)
```
