# Hello World Project

A simple, world-class "Hello World" application written in Python.

## Description

This project demonstrates the most fundamental concept in programming: displaying "Hello World" to the console. While simple, this project follows best practices including proper documentation and a clean, maintainable structure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Installation

### Local Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/hello-world-project.git
   cd hello-world-project
   ```

2. No additional dependencies are required for the basic functionality.

### Docker Installation

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. Visit [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions.

## How to Run

### Using Python directly

Execute the main.py file using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or make the file executable and run it directly:

```bash
chmod +x main.py
./main.py
```

### Using Docker

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t hello-world .
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --rm hello-world
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the Python code that prints "Hello World" to the console
- `README.md`: This file, containing project documentation
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration for building a Docker image of the application
- `.dockerignore`: Specifies files to exclude from the Docker build context
- `test_main.py`: Unit tests for the main functionality
- `test_docker.py`: Tests for Docker functionality

## Testing

Run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
python -m unittest test_main.py
```

For testing Docker functionality (requires Docker to be installed):

```bash
python -m unittest test_docker.py
```

## Expected Output

When you run the program, you should see the following output:

```
Hello World
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python not found**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed and in your PATH.
2. **Permission denied when running ./main.py**: Make sure you've made the file executable with `chmod +x main.py`.
3. **Docker build fails**: Verify Docker is installed and running on your system.
